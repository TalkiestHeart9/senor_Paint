What would be added given time:

  * eraser tool
  * cool new shape

  * safe exit does not work as intended

  * can not draw ploygon
  * no cut tool

Expected next sprint:
* have at least 3 unit tests.  (More info coming in class...)
* have a timer that allows for "autosave" [every X seconds, it saves a temporary copy - it should NOT overwrite the existing file if any]; ideally this should be threaded.  This timer should be visible/invisible to the user at their option.  X should be something that can be set by the user.  If changed, it should persist on the next use of the software on that machine.]
* have some JavaDoc commenting.  (More info on this coming, also)
* have icons for tools
* have updated help
* have mouseover help for controls (if a icons+text as the tool, a short explanation is sufficient - if icons only were used, just a text name is sufficient)

New features:
  * keyboard ui, such as ctrl s for save or alt f for file
  * can open multiple image files
  * draw circle, square, elipse, and circle
  * zoom in and out
Known issues:
  * no tabs
  * no color grabber
  * no text tool
  * safe exit does not work as intended
Expected next sprint:
  * have an Undo/Redo using an abstract data type ("stack" preferred/recommended); you should not use the FX built in tool!
  * provide Blank / starter image (a tab or the tool should not have just a grey tab...)
  * have an additional shape of your choice
  * have an eraser tool
  * be able to draw a "regular" (same side length) polygon with the user specifying the # of sides.
  * Live draw / interactive draw (you should "see" the line or shape as you draw it)
  * [The Big One] Select a piece of the image and move it.
